# The Dark Hordes: Reborn

## Campaign Description

This is the story of an age when the glory of Irdya was becoming memories of the former days. The fugitive necromancer Gwiti Ha’atel is resolved to master the undead hordes and take revenge against the people...

(Novice level, 14 scenarios.)

## Unit Descriptions

### Initiate

Dabbling in the Death Magic, this young Ha’atel’s lust for power has weakened him to the point where he is too weak to attack in regular combat.

### Deathmaster

His wanderings on a dark path have given him power normally not granted to mortals, but with a terrible cost: the undead that he gave his soul to are gradually claiming his mortal shell too, and with time, he will be a true undead and a terror to all that lives.

### Grimreaper

His wanderings on a dark path have given him power normally not granted to mortals, but with a terrible cost: the undead that he gave his soul to are gradually claiming his mortal shell too, and with time, he will be a true undead and a terror to all that lives.

### Demilich

After too much time dabbling with forbidden magics and dark arts, these magi have begun to pay a heavy price. Demiliches have started losing their bodies, becoming undead themselves. With time, they may become fully undead, and feared by all alike.

### Dread Lich

At long last, Ha’atel has paid the ultimate sacrifice for the dark arts into which he has delved, and has, himself, entered into undeath. At the apex of his power, he has become a lich, a waking embodiment of dread. He has, beyond any doubt, passed the point of no return, and his power and immortality will have to provide consolation for what he has lost in his quest to achieve them.

## Scenario “A New Chance”

### Introduction

At a great battle at the Stone of Erzen, the brothers Gwiti and Nati Ha’atel showed their skills for the first time: believing that their side was losing the battle, they called upon the corpses of former enemies to rise again and fight on their side.

However, not only was this forbidden, but rash as well. The cavalry meant to come as reinforcements instead clashed with the undead legions, and so the battle was lost where it would have been won had it not been for these two dark sorcerers.

The Ha’atel brothers fled. However, they were seized by the Wesnothians not long after. They were clapped in irons, marched onto a ship with no rudder, and sent off to drown in the sea, for the Wesnothians feared that their corpses might only rise again.

But Fate intervened. The ship carrying Gwiti and Nati was beset by a sudden storm and disintegrated, separating the brothers and washing them both ashore. This was the beginning of the Rise of the Dark Hordes.

### Game Start

Gwiti: My whole body still aches... Where the hell is this strange beach?

Narrator: The area was blighted. Not one human being was there.

Gwiti: Apparently the gods have not yet completely abandoned me. The smell of the beast is in the air around here — perhaps they are the material for testing whether I shall survive. Conveniently for me, this ruin is piled high with corpses.

Xabrak: Hey! Look over there! The necromancer is attacking us with skeletons!

Grakarat: I hate skeletons! I hate humans! But I love the feel of crushing them.

### Gabtur’s Joining

Unit: Who are you in the cage?

Gabtur: This area is dangerous... This is the den of the savages who killed me and captured me again.

Gwiti: I have already sent many of them to their deaths. You should join my uprising.

### Apprentice’s Joining (Upon Xabrak’s Defeat)

Gwiti: Death is good for the nagas that bother me!

Xabrak: I am... defeated...

Gwiti: Who is hiding there?

Apprentice: I almost got eaten by them...

Gwiti: You seem to be necromancer like me. Then come with me. Obey me and you will become more mighty.

Apprentice: I understood. Master!

Narrator: You can now recruit **Dark Adepts** and **Vampire Bats**!

### Upon Victory (Leganoth’s Whisper)

Voice: Gwiti — you must not delay. Your destiny is at hand.

Gwiti: What? Who the hell are you? Why are you speaking to my heart?

Voice: Your brother Nati is exploring this land, just like you. And from now on you must confront him, for one of you brothers shall be destroyed.

### Upon Player’s Defeat

Gwiti: Noooo! Not now, not when I have escaped!

### Time Over

Gwiti: The Wesnothians have discovered my escape! This is not good...

## Scenario “Brother Against Brother”

### Introduction

Gwiti followed the words of the distant voice and explored the unknown land...

### Game Start

Narrator: As the sun set, Gwiti discovered that his arch-rival and brother, Nati, had already ensconced himself nearby.

Gwiti: Ah, hated brother mine. Look well upon the setting sun, for you shall not live to see another in this land.

Nati: This land? Do you truly not know where we are? Then you are a greater fool than I had thought.

Gwiti: Cease your blustering; the darkness shall always be upon my side. You must die to prove it.

Nati: I will fight you with all my strength to prevent that, and I was always the stronger of us. Flee now and save your miserable hide before I make it a carpet.

Gwiti: Don’t be silly! I’m not hairy enough to be a carpet! But your scalp would make a good pillow.

### Turn 6 (Nati’s Army Enhances)

Nati: Your doom is at hand!

Gwiti: His legions are nothing more than hodge-podge... It is only the matter of time before I beat him.

### Turn 8 (Leganoth’s Whisper)

Voice: How does it feel to face your foolish brother? Whether you can resist your destiny depends upon your magic.

Gwiti: You again... Who the hell are you?

Voice: One Ha’atel that stays alive is more than enough — Gwiti.

Gwiti: Where the hell are you now?

### Turn 9 (Dawn)

Nati: You miserable wretch, know that it is only by my mercy that you look upon the sun again, for you shall die before it sets.

Gwiti: May I remind you that even as we speak, my undead legions are marching towards you?

### Gwiti’s Attacking

Gwiti: Anyone who stands in my way will be burned to ashes!

### Nati’s Attacking (Towards Gwiti)

Nati: Now you shall die!

### Upon Victory

Nati: My foolish brother... Our doom began when we were born. You are just slightly longer-lasting in your luck.

Gwiti: Is that all you want to say? I will surely stay alive and take revenge against Wesnoth. You must go to the Land of the Dead and prepare to join my hordes.

Nati: It is over... I am doomed.

### Upon Player’s Defeat

Gwiti: What? I can’t die! I already have! Noooo!

Nati: Ha ha ha, did I not tell you it would be so? Perhaps I shall summon your shade to serve me one day. Until then... farewell!
